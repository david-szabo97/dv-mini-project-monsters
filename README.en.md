# Monsters
> Frontend exercise project

## Requirements
- Adding new monsters
- Listing of added monsters
- Deleting of added monsters one by one
- Search by monsters' name in list

## Attributes of a monster
- One of the four elements: Fire, Earth, Air, Water (string/integer/enum)
- Name (string)
- Attack power (integer)
- Defense power (integer)

## Interface requirements
The following have to be displayed on the interface:
- project logo (`logo.svg`)
- project title (Monsters)
- form to add new monsters
  - here we need to be able to choose the element of the monster with a left and right arrow (`icons/arrow-left.svg`, `icons/arrow-right.svg`). Between the arrows, display the current element (`icons/air.svg`, `icons/water.svg`, `icons/earth.svg`, `icons/fire.svg`)
  - a text field where one can name the monster
  - a number field for giving the monster an attack power, next to it display the attack icon (`icons/attack.svg`)
  - a number field for giving the monster a defense power, next to it display the defense icon (`icons/defense.svg`)
  - a button to add the monster, after pressing the button the monster appears on the list and the form resets to the default empty state.
- a list to show all the monsters
- a search field to filter by name in said list
- inside the list we must see
  - the icon of the monster's element (`icons/air.svg`, `icons/water.svg`, `icons/earth.svg`, `icons/fire.svg`)
  - name of the monster
  - attack power of the monster and its icon (`icons/attack.svg`)
